      <summary>History of games...</summary>
      <div class="content">
        <h2>Did you know?</h2>
        <p>The history of games goes back to antiquity <br>Games have always been a part of every culture in the past.<br>
        They have been culturally and socially significant, and they had shown the status of a person in a time when we were not there yet. <br>
        The first is gaming tools made of bones. This dice was created 5000 years ago, but dice was probably not with six walls. They were once also used for the function of oracles or omens.<br> </p>
        <img src="images/ancientdice.png" class="media" alt="ancient dice" width=100% ><br>
        <p>Board games originated in the ancient Middle East. Found in an ancient tomb dating back 5000 years are elements of a game created 5000 years ago! <br></p>
        <p>One of the first computer games was called Spacewar! and started in 1962 under Steven Russell's case. It was about controlling spaceships around a star; that year, it was multiplayer, meaning two people could play it simultaneously. It was written on a computer DEC PDP 1. This hardware was equipped with a round monochrome display, and on a black background were visible white objects made in vector graphics.<br></p>

        <p>One computer game made in 3d Battlezone was created in 1980 and could be played only on slot machines. The player controlled the tank with the help of a joystick. The task was to shoot at other tanks.<br></p>

        <p>Scientists from Florida conducted an INVESTIGATION, thanks to which they discovered that a short break in work on the game increased intellectual efficiency and work efficiency. <br></p>
        <p>For six weeks, the Oxford Institute has been researching the harmfulness of gambling on our mental health. Based on the study, with 40 thousand observations, scientists concluded that playing the game does not cause any negative psychological changes in the minds of gamers.<br></p>
        <p>Another interesting fact is that a group of people 2015 founded the company Stack Up, which aims to connect war veterans and civilian sympathizers to play games together. The company's allies aimed to prevent the suicide of war veterans who had finished their service with a view to their mental health. The program turned out to be perfect. Many people made new friendships and received the support they expected after traumatic experiences during the hearing. 70% of users of this company's software play in one room have a sense of community and mutual support, which is an essential ingredient for their mental health after difficult experiences on the service.<br></p>

          <p>Work is not 100% of our lives. In addition to earning money, we should also find space for nurturing family life and social contacts and broadly understood self-development. Write down your most important tasks for the next week in the categories: work, family, health, and self-development. Prioritize each of them on a scale of 1-3. Then implement them consistently. That way, you can easily suck off insignificant tasks and focus on what's important. Try to balance work and life at the same time. Note that you can delegate or delete some tasks altogether from the list if they are irrelevant .</p>

            <summary>EXERCISE - Three-minute relaxation at work</summary>
            <div class="content">
              <p>Sit straight on the edge of the chair. Smile.</p>
                <li>
                  <ul>Breathe. Take five slow, deep breaths and clear your mind of all worries and thoughts. Take your thoughts away from what you were just doing.</ul>
                  <ul>Neck and shoulders. Raise your shoulders, trying to touch your ears. At the same time, put your hands in front of you. Tighten your arms and shoulders for five seconds. Then relax.</ul>
                  <ul>Raise your shoulders again. Put your hands sideways this time. Tighten your arms and shoulders for five seconds. Then relax. Make a gentle turn of your head: two times to the right and two times to the left. Don't forget to breathe.</ul>
                  <ul>Back. Put your hands over your head and pretend you're using them to climb the ladder. Do it slowly and rhythmically for ten seconds. Then relax. Look straight ahead, still sitting on the edge of the chair. At the same time, slowly and carefully make a right turn as far as you can, trying to grab the back of the chair.</ul>
                  <ul>Legs. Raise your right leg. Perform foot circulation five times. Repeat the exercise with your left leg.</ul>
                  <ul>Repeat the whole exercise. Lift both legs. Pull your toes together to feel the tension in your calves. Hold this position for five seconds. Then relax.</ul>
                  <ul>Breathing. Imagine that you are in a nice and quiet place. Close your eyes. Relax any part of your body where you feel tension. For the next minute, breathe slowly and deeply.</ul>
                  <ul>The real world. Return to your activities rested and relaxed. Use this three-minute relaxation when you feel the tension rising.</ul>
                </li>
              <br>
              <p>Stop thinking.</p>
                <li>
                  <ul>Take a deep breath. Hold your breath for 4 seconds.</ul>
                  <ul>Exhale the air from the lungs for 4 seconds.</ul>
                  <ul>Wait 4 seconds before taking your next breath.</ul>
                  <ul>Repeat four cycles.</ul>
                  <ul>Repeat this exercise as often as necessary. When we breathe deliberately and slowly, the brain is unable to activate its anxiety programs.</ul>
                </li>
              <br>
              <p>Take a deep breath.</p>
                <li>
                  <ul>Start rolling the eyes as wide as possible (to the outer edges of the eye sockets).</ul>
                  <ul>Make 4-6 complete circles.</ul>
                  <ul>Take another deep breath.</ul>
                  <ul>This simple method works fast!</ul>
                </li>
              <br>
              <p>Take another deep breath.</p>
                <li>
                  <ul>Tap your forefingers on your cheeks (quite hard).</ul>
                  <ul>Do it 10 to 20 times.</ul>
